* Help-a-Friend allows people to request any kind of service (within the boundaries of the law) and create a pin designating where they require the service and any additional information
* The pin requests are displayed on google maps and are visible by anyone signed up with the app
* Other users can then accept a request for help and agree to work with the person seeking aid to complete the task and earn "resepct" or even cash/other reqards if the request details
* This app is designed aiming for smaller communities and especially for people who are unable to complete simple tasks on their own (i.e. the elderly, people with dissabilities or people without access)
